# Spec: obzorarr

**Status:** the ground floor (skeleton) is specified here, approved by the orchestrator
(2026-10-18) and built. Product modules aren't specified yet (see the capability map).

## Objective

obzorarr is a private year in review for a Plex Media Server: it reads the server's play history and
gives each member a personal recap, plus a server-wide recap, as an animated story, with an admin
panel for the server's owner ([PRODUCT.md](../PRODUCT.md), [legacy spec](product/legacy-spec.md)).

**This spec covers only the ground floor:** an empty, production-shaped SvelteKit app that builds,
type-checks, tests, lints and serves on Bun, styled from the design tokens, with the edbfi Bun web
CI around it. It has no database, authentication, Plex, sync, recap or any other product feature. Its
job is to make the first module spec cheap to build: every later PR adds behaviour, not plumbing.

## Capability map

Placeholder. Product modules come later, each through an owner-approved `docs/SPEC-<id>.md`. The map
(module ids, dependencies, build order) is proposed with `spec-driven-development` Phase 0 after the
skeleton has merged, from the legacy spec and the [surface briefs](../.impeccable/surfaces/). No
module id exists yet.

**First after the ground floor:** the three-slide recap spike
([D19](decisions.md#d19-the-animated-recap)). The animated recap is the surface most likely to need
custom work beyond Panda CSS and Ark UI, so three slides are built before its design is committed.
The spike gets its own owner-approved spec; the rest of the map is proposed with it or after it.

## Tech stack

The stack decisions are in [decisions.md](decisions.md) (D1–D12). Versions are exact pins in
`package.json` (Bun from its `packageManager` field) and `bun.lock`; Dependabot moves them. Every
package is a dev dependency, so adapter-bun bundles it and `bun ./build` needs no `node_modules`.

| Part | Package |
|---|---|
| Runtime and package manager | Bun |
| Language | `typescript` (6.x) |
| UI framework | `svelte` / `@sveltejs/kit` |
| Build | `vite` / `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` |
| Adapter | `@sveltejs/adapter-bun` |
| Styling | `@pandacss/dev`, `@pandacss/vite` (its Vite plugin), `@pandacss/preset-base` |
| Primitives | `@ark-ui/svelte` |
| Type check | `svelte-check` |
| Unit tests | `vitest` (`node` environment); `happy-dom` joins with the first component test |
| e2e | `@playwright/test` (Chromium) |
| Lint and format | `@biomejs/biome` |

Setup facts for this stack:
- SvelteKit 3 is configured through its Vite plugin (`vite.config.ts`); there's no
  `svelte.config.js`. `tsconfig.json` extends `$app/tsconfig`, which `svelte-kit sync` generates.
- Package subpath imports replace `$lib` and need explicit file targets: `#lib/*` maps to
  `./src/lib/*` and imports name the file with its extension (`#lib/server/health.ts`);
  `#styled-system/*` maps to the generated `./styled-system/*/index.js`.
- Assets are imported through Vite from `src/lib/assets/`: the root layout takes the favicon from
  `#lib/assets/obzorarr-icon.svg`, so there's no `static/` folder.
- `svelte-kit sync` runs before Panda's codegen, in `prepare` and in `check`.
- The Panda Vite plugin appends the generated CSS to the stylesheet that declares the layer order
  (`src/app.css`), and `transform: true` turns static `css()` calls into class strings at build
  time.
- Hook types come from `@sveltejs/kit/hooks`.
- Tools run under Bun with `--bun`; a lifecycle script (`prepare`) calls each bin as
  `bun --bun <bin>`, because `bun ci` doesn't apply `--bun` to lifecycle scripts.
- Bun blocks `@parcel/watcher`'s install script (it builds with Node); Panda works without it.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `bun ci` | frozen install; `prepare` runs `svelte-kit sync` and Panda codegen |
| `bun run --bun dev` | Vite dev server |
| `bun run --bun build` | production build through adapter-bun into `build/` |
| `bun run --bun preview` | runs the built server (`bun ./build`; `PORT`, default 3000, and `HOST`) |
| `bun run --bun check` | `svelte-kit sync`, Panda codegen, then `svelte-check` failing on any error or warning |
| `bun run --bun test` | Vitest unit tests, once (no watch) |
| `bun run --bun smoke` | Playwright e2e smoke; it starts the built server, so `build` comes first, and Chromium comes from `bunx --bun playwright install chromium` |
| `bun run --bun lint` | `biome check` |
| `prek run --all-files --hook-stage manual` | everything CI's `checks` job runs |

## Project structure

The folder tree is in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#structure) and its rules in
[Code structure](../AGENTS.md#code-structure).

## Code style

Biome's defaults with the shared `biome.json` (tabs, double quotes, 100 columns). TypeScript strict;
`#lib/…` imports. File names and layout follow
[Code structure](../AGENTS.md#code-structure).

```ts
import { healthResponse } from "#lib/server/health.ts";
import type { RequestHandler } from "./$types";

export const GET: RequestHandler = () => healthResponse();
```

## Design tokens

- [`panda.config.ts`](../panda.config.ts) holds every design token: colours, type styles,
  spacing, radii, layout sizes, breakpoints and motion durations, under the names DESIGN.md uses.
  It replaced the seed token files that came with the design package.
- Colours are semantic tokens behind a colour-mode condition (`_dark`), dark by default
  (`class="dark"` on `<html>` in `src/app.html`); After Hours is the only theme, and other themes
  can be added later without touching components (ground-floor choice 4).
- Only `@pandacss/preset-base` is loaded (utilities and conditions), so no preset palette competes
  with the app's tokens, and `strictTokens` makes a raw value in `css()` a type error that `check`
  reports.
- The placeholder page uses only Panda tokens: no raw colour, size or font values in components.
  It stays quiet: no projector-light imagery or recap motion, which belong to the landing and recap
  modules.

## Testing strategy

- **Unit (Vitest, `node` environment):** one test, for the `/healthz` handler: status 200, body
  `ok`, `cache-control: no-store`. Component tests use happy-dom when components exist; never jsdom.
- **e2e (Playwright, Chromium, under Bun):** one smoke test against the built adapter-bun server.
  It checks that `/` returns 200, shows the placeholder heading, hydrates (it waits for the
  `data-hydrated` attribute the root layout sets when mounted), applies the Panda background token
  and display text style and logs no console errors, and that `/healthz` returns `ok`.
- prek runs the unit tests (`tests` hook); CI's `smoke` job builds and runs the smoke test.

## CI and repo tooling

obzorarr is a Bun web repo with edbfi-ci's Bun web templates:
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Biome, `biome-migrate`, `check-peers`, the `tests` hook, plus a
  `check` hook (`bun run --bun check`), keeping the vendored-skill exclusions and the `docs-set`
  hook.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `checks` (prek), `smoke` (Chromium install, build, smoke) and `audit`
  (outside PRs); `checks` and `smoke` sit behind `ci-ok`, every job that installs runs with failing
  `node`, `npm` and `npx` on `PATH`, and the weekly run is `29 3 * * 0`.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` covers `github-actions`, `pre-commit` and `bun`, and
  `.github/workflows/biome-migrate.yml` applies Biome migrations to Dependabot's Biome PRs.

## Boundaries

- **Always:** Bun with `--bun` for every tool; tokens only through Panda; keep SvelteKit's
  configuration in the Vite plugin; prek green before each commit.
- **Ask first:** any dependency not in the tech stack table; any change to `biome.json` (it is
  shared by the five rewrite apps); any CI shape that differs from the edbfi-ci template.
- **Never:** a database, authentication, Plex, sync, a recap slide or any other product feature; a
  second styling tool or primitive library; Node, npm or npx anywhere, including CI.

## Success criteria

1. A fresh clone passes `bun ci`, `bun run --bun check` (zero errors and warnings), `bun run --bun
   test`, `bun run --bun build`, `bun run --bun smoke` and `prek run --all-files --hook-stage
   manual`, with no Node on `PATH`.
2. The built server (`bun ./build`) serves `/` with the placeholder page and `/healthz` with `ok`.
3. `panda.config.ts` holds every design token; the seed token files are gone, and nothing in `src/`
   uses a raw colour, size or font value.
4. Only folders with real files exist; `#lib` resolves in app code, tests and `svelte-check`.
5. CI on the PR runs `checks`, `smoke` and `ci-ok` green; `audit` runs outside PRs.

## Ground-floor choices

Choices 1–3 are carried over from the first rewrite app's skeleton, since obzorarr's design doesn't
call for anything different; choices 4 and 5 are obzorarr's own.

1. **Fonts.** DESIGN.md wants Space Grotesk, Instrument Sans and IBM Plex Mono bundled locally. The
   skeleton defines the font tokens with system fallbacks; the first surface adds the font files (a
   dependency the owner approves then).
2. **Ark UI before its first use.** The skeleton installs `@ark-ui/svelte`, so the Panda and Ark
   pairing and `check-peers` are settled early; the first `ui/` wrapper comes with the first surface
   that needs one.
3. **Security headers and CSP.** The legacy app set a nonce-based CSP and security headers on every
   response (legacy spec, "Security"). They belong to the first module that serves real pages, not
   the skeleton.
4. **Themes.** The legacy app lets the owner pick the admin panel's theme and the recap's theme
   independently, from five presets; the design seeds both to After Hours. The skeleton defines After
   Hours as the only theme, its colours as semantic tokens behind the dark colour-mode condition, and
   the module that brings back the two theme settings decides whether more presets return and how
   Panda switches them.
5. **CSP and the recap spike.** Whether the recap spike carries the security headers and CSP (choice
   3) is decided by the spike's own spec, since only it knows whether the spike is served to users.
