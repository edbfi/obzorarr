# Decisions

Each entry is a decision and why it was made. Open entries keep their number when they're settled.
The stack entries come from the shared rewrite recipe used by all five edbfi apps, cut down to what
applies to obzorarr. Versions live in `package.json` once it exists.

## Decided

### D1. SvelteKit on one origin

Svelte 5 and SvelteKit 3, with TypeScript for browser and server code. SvelteKit serves pages, form
actions, API endpoints and assets on one origin, with server rendering on and interactive components
in the browser. Backend work happens in server routes, server `load` functions and form actions,
which call application services.

Why: one framework and one origin for every surface (landing, member area, recaps and the owner's
admin panel) keeps sessions, origin checks and deployment simple, and it's the recipe all five apps
share.

### D2. TypeScript 6, strict

The latest stable TypeScript 6.x at bootstrap, locked; no prereleases, and major upgrades wait until
the Svelte tooling supports them. Strict type checking, run explicitly (the `check` script): running
TypeScript under Bun doesn't type-check it. External input is validated at runtime.

Why: [SvelteKit 3 requires TypeScript 6](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/migrating-to-sveltekit-3#Updated-dependencies).

### D3. Bun everywhere, no Node

Bun is the runtime and package manager in development, CI and production. Tools run with `--bun`
(`bun run --bun`, `bunx --bun`) so their Node shebangs don't apply; no `node`, `npm` or `npx`.
Packages still come from the npm registry. `bun.lock` is committed and CI installs with
`bun install --frozen-lockfile`.

Why: one runtime for every step, and the official Bun adapter needs it.

### D4. One container, one process, one port

[`@sveltejs/adapter-bun`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-bun) builds a Bun server. obzorarr
runs as one application process with one HTTP port in one container; container packaging lives in
the separate `obzorarr-docker` repository. Secrets are configured separately from the database and
used only in server-only code.

Why: a single self-hosted instance for one owner and tens of viewers doesn't need more, and
in-memory state (rate limits, the live-sync lock, sync progress) can assume one process (see D17).

### D5. Embedded Turso through Drizzle

The database is embedded Turso (`@tursodatabase/database`) through Drizzle
(`drizzle-orm/tursodatabase/database`), with the database file on a persistent data volume. Drizzle
Kit generates SQL migrations, which are reviewed and committed. Migrations run before the app
accepts requests or starts jobs, with one migration owner per database.

Drizzle must be `1.0.0-rc.5-5935859` (the verified reference, D15) or a later release that keeps its
Turso transaction fix (Drizzle
[`25abe07`](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/commit/25abe0785e09cb562d999c9b6b8d92d85e3e7053),
using the API from [Turso #7898](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/pull/7898)). Never
`1.0.0-rc.4`: it can roll back unrelated writes that share the connection, and upgrading Turso alone
doesn't fix it.

Why: one file on one volume matches the one-process deployment and keeps backup simple; the
rollback-isolation check passed with the fixed adapter and no application-level write queue.

### D6. Transactions and data access

Database access sits behind named operations (insert a page of play history, claim the sync slot).
Application services own the business rules and the transaction boundaries. Every statement in a
transaction goes through the callback's transaction object; transactions stay short, and network
calls happen outside them. No generic layer that promises interchangeable SQL dialects.

Why: Turso transactions use async callbacks, and a statement outside the transaction handle escapes
it. obzorarr targets one engine, so a dialect abstraction would be cost without benefit.

### D7. In-process background jobs

Jobs (scheduled and live sync, enrichment, log retention) belong to application startup and
shutdown, never to page requests. Job state is persisted so work recovers after a restart, runs
never overlap, and retries are safe.

Why: SvelteKit and Drizzle provide none of this lifecycle, and the legacy app needed exactly these
guarantees: one sync at a time, interrupted runs marked failed at boot, and the scheduler's intent
rebuilt from storage after a restart.

### D8. SSRF-safe outbound HTTP

Every outbound call goes through server-side `fetch` with explicit address validation and a redirect
policy.

Why: the Plex address and the AI provider's base URL are admin-supplied, so the server must not
become a proxy to arbitrary hosts.

### D9. Generated HTTP API clients

Typed HTTP API clients come from `@hey-api/openapi-ts`, generated from the app's own OpenAPI
document during the build. Generated files are never edited by hand. Page loads and form actions use
SvelteKit's generated types instead; services call database operations directly.

Why: one typed contract for the JSON endpoints, without hand-written client code drifting from it.

### D10. Panda CSS and Ark UI only

Styling is Panda CSS 2 through its Vite plugin, with build-time transforms on. Accessible primitives
come from Ark UI for Svelte, unstyled and styled with Panda tokens. Design tokens are defined once,
in Panda's configuration. No second styling tool or primitive library.

Why: one token source and one primitive library keep the design system (DESIGN.md) enforceable.

### D11. Structured logs to standard output

Logs are structured, one entry per line, written to standard output. The library is open (D14).

Why: the container runtime collects stdout; structured lines can be filtered without parsing prose.

### D12. Plex through `@ctrl/plex` behind a provider

obzorarr uses [`@ctrl/plex`](https://github.com/scttcper/plex) wherever it supports the needed
behaviour, and Bun's `fetch` only for missing endpoints or app-specific variations, after checking the
library's implementation. Both sit behind one server-only Plex provider: services call methods such
as `listHistory()`, never build Plex requests. The provider applies consistent timeouts, error
handling and runtime response validation. Each custom method documents the missing library
behaviour beside it and is revisited when the library gains it. The
[official Plex API specification](https://developer.plex.tv/) is the reference for Media Server
operations, and `@hey-api/openapi-ts` may generate types or calls from a pinned copy; there's only
ever one implementation of an operation.

obzorarr's Plex scope is playback history, metadata, sign-in and membership checks. History is read
page by page; server-local account ids are mapped to Plex identities; runtime totals are estimates
of viewing time, not time watched. Membership means the configured server is currently shared with
the account, and the only administrator is the server's owner.

Why: a maintained library covers most operations, and one provider boundary keeps the access rules
(a server share, proven ownership) explicit and testable.

## Open

### D13. Producing the OpenAPI document

How the OpenAPI document is generated from SvelteKit endpoints isn't chosen. The generator must be
validated with the pinned TypeScript 6 and Bun versions. Closes when the first JSON endpoint needs a
generated client.

### D14. Logging library and job lifecycle

The logging library (D11) and the concrete job lifecycle implementation (D7) aren't chosen. Close
before the first background job lands.

### D15. Turso and Drizzle versions

The exact Drizzle ORM and Drizzle Kit pair for Turso is still to be validated in the app: migrations,
type checking, production builds and rollback isolation (D5). Only a focused rollback-isolation check
has passed (Drizzle `1.0.0-rc.5-5935859` with Turso `0.8.3` and `0.9.0-pre.1`). Closes with the first
database module.

### D16. Runtime validation gaps

Not yet validated for this stack: browser hydration and interaction (only server rendering and
emitted assets passed), production containers, realistic load, and job recovery after a restart.
A crash test doesn't prove recovery from power loss or storage faults. The Turso backup and restore
procedure is still to be defined and tested; the database file and the secrets must be restored
together. Each closes with the work that first depends on it.

### D17. One process

The deployment assumes one application process per database. Horizontal scaling and job
coordination across processes would need a new design. Stays open as an accepted limit.

### D18. Plex library audit

The Plex operations obzorarr needs (D12) still have to be audited against a pinned `@ctrl/plex`
version, checked for Bun and TypeScript 6 compatibility, and tested for request payloads and
response parsing, including history pagination and the local-account mapping. Sign-in and the
membership checks must be verified against Plex before they replace a working flow. Closes with the
Plex provider.

### D19. The animated recap

The animated recap is the surface most likely to need custom work beyond Panda CSS and Ark UI. Three
slides are built as a spike before its design is committed. Closes with that spike, the first module
after the ground floor.
